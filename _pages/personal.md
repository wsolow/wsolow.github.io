I grew up in a small town in Vermont which gave me a profound appreciation for spending time in the outdoors with friends. When I'm not in the office, adventures in the mountains keep me refreshed and excited!

As a member of the Division I Nordic Ski Team at Colby College, Waterville, ME, I raced for four years which included two top-30 finishes at NCAAs, and two podium finishes at Junior Nationals. Results aside, 15 years of competitive skiing taught me how to enjoy being outside, no matter the weather!

Prepping to surf off mid-coast Maine. 40 degree water temps necessitate plenty of neoprene!

Trail running in Vermont and New Hampshire are my happiest places - rugged roots and rocks abound! Now that I live in Oregon, I have set my sights on running loops around many of the volcanoes.
