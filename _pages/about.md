Hi! I am a PhD student at [Oregon State University](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/EECS) in the [Intelligent and Reliable Autonomous Systems (IRAS)](https://www.sandhyasai.com/group) group, advised by [Dr. Sandhya Saisubramanian](https://www.sandhyasai.com/).

My research interests lie in sequential decision making problems. Broadly, I aim to support the design of autonomous agents that are safe and reliable. I currently work on real-time model calibration problems, motivated by safety-critical applications to decision making problems in agriculture.

Previously, I have worked on constraint inference methods in reinforcement learning.

My work is currently funded by the [AgAid Institue](https://agaid.org/). 

I've been fortunate to have the opportunity to work with interdisciplinary teams in Agriculture and Chemistry. I enjoy working on problems in ML/AI that are motivated by real-world applications, particularly in Agriculture, Climate, and Healthcare. The problem statements that naturally arise in these settings provide an exciting array of challenges from an AI perspective, with the promise of directly impacting humans.

Interested in collaborating on a problem? Please email me!
